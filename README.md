 About:-
       I am a tech-enthusiast and also a passionate programmer.

  Challenges:-
          1. Built this project entirely on my      mobile phone, so got a little bit    slow.
          2. Dealt with serious backlog due to    illness.
          
  Accomplishment:-
    As mentioned earlier I built this project on my mobile phone only , so I am proud of having done a work on a much under-performimg device than everyone else was using and also finishing it on time.
    
 Future Improvements:-
      Will be looking to add some styling and animations to the page and make it more decorative.
